# Rapid Game Prototype - Assessment 4: Weee!

**Team Members:** Alexandra Drury, Mae Maillols, Matthew Pettett

## Game Credits:
**Code:** Alexandra Drury, Matthew Pettett & Mae Maillols

**Art/3D Assets:** Mae Maillols and Alexandra Drury

**Music and SFX:** Alexandra Drury - all original created with BeepBox (except for the invincible music, 
which was obviously a recreation of the Mario Kart Invincibility music)

## Game Controls (during gameplay):
- Left Click anywhere on the screen = flip to the opposite wall
- Double Left Click/Second Left Click quickly after your first click = Jump/Reverse direction/cancel flip
- P = Pause (You cannot pause during the tutorial section)
- Left Click the pause button  = Pause

## Game Mechanics:
- Your Score/Points are based on time played plus the number of coins and green spikes collected
- One coin = 10 points
- Green Lightning Bolt = Invincibility. Spikes won’t kill you when you are invincible. If you touch the green spikes while invincible, you will gain 5 points
- Shield = protects you from hitting one spike. It is infinite but will disappear if you hit a spike
- While the spikes are red, hitting them will cause the player to die
- The longer a run is the faster the game becomes, and therefore it will become more difficult as time progresses
- When you collect a power-up and if you already have a power-up, the new power-up will replace your current one
- When the player jumps/reverses direction/cancels their flip, the player will turn white, which indicates a 3 second cool-down before they can take that action again,
which is indicated when the player returns to being blue

## Tutorial
- You can toggle the tutorial on and off
- It is automatically on the first time you play, then it will automatically turn off until you toggle it on again
- You can’t die in the tutorial, the game stops, allowing you to read the instructions, and then complete the action instructed
